# Contributing to CMiNet

The following guidelines are designed for contributors to **CMiNet**.

## Reporting Issues and Questions

For reporting a bug, a failed function, or requesting a new feature, please open an issue in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/solislemuslab/CMiNet/issues).  
First, search through existing issues (open or closed) that might already address your question.  

If you are reporting a bug, please include:
- A minimal reproducible example (code + sample data if possible)
- The expected behavior
- The actual behavior observed
- Your R version and operating system
- Any error messages

For general questions, please:
- Check the [User Guide and Examples](https://github.com/solislemuslab/CMiNet)
- Review the online Shiny app at [https://cminet.wid.wisc.edu](https://cminet.wid.wisc.edu)  
If you still cannot find an answer, open a new GitHub issue. We will respond as soon as possible, though our team is small and we appreciate your patience.
